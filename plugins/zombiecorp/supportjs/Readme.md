# Zombiecorp Support JS

This plugin adds commonly used JS items to the project in a neat tight little bundle.

## Masks

When you need to mask an input, you can now use a declarative way of doing so. All you need to do is include the `zc-mask` attribute to you field. Currently supported are these masks:

- cep - used for brazilian Zip Codes - format `00000-000`
- telefone - used for brazilian phone number with flexible format for mobile phones - `(00) 00000-0000 / (00) 0000-0000`
- telefonefixo - used for brazilian phone number - `(00) 0000-0000`
- cnpj - Brazilian Company registration number - `000.000.000\0000-00`
- cpf - Brazilian personal registration number - `000.000.000-00`
